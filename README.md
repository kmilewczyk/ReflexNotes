# About
ReflexNotes is an in-development app tasked with facilitating the writing of impromptu notes and their later ordering and revision. It is web-based, cross-platform, with an optional server backend that synchronises the persistent data between all users.

# Why
From personal experience, notetaking can be a chore with all the preparation that needs to be done to make the gathered information accessible later. Sometimes, there is a need to be flexible enough to quickly note down things on the spot and worry about the bookkeeping later. And then you forget about the notes, making your notebook a mess.

The app aims to provide the most straightforward and lax notetaking possible and set up a dashboard to monitor yet-to-be-edited information. That way, the "laziness" of writing on the back of the handkerchief can be remedied by occasional reordering and formatting. The result then can be scheduled to be revised and committed to memory by spaced learning.

# Quickstart
Too early in the development.
